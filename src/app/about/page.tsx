          <br /> Hello, Iam Aliza Batool, a passionate and driven Frontend Developer<br /> with a solid expertise
             in TypeScript, HTML, CSS, NEXT.JS, and Tailwind . My journey in web development is marked by a continuous pursuit of knowledge
            and excellence. Currently, I am a student in the GIAIC program, where I am not only refining my
            existing skills but also embracing new technologies and methodologies that are shaping the future of web 
            development.
         <br/>
         <br />
         My approach to development is grounded in the belief that great user experiences start with clean,
         maintainable code and an eye for detail. I take pride in crafting interfaces that are not only
         aesthetically pleasing but also highly functional and responsive across all devices. 
         I thrive on challenges and am always eager to learn and adopt the latest industry trends and best practices.
         <br />
         <br />
        
         As I continue to grow in this dynamic field, I am excited to contribute to innovative projects that push
         the limits of what web technologies can achieve. My goal is to not only meet the expectations
         of clients and users but to surpass them, delivering solutions that are both elegant and effective.
